Lung Cancer Prediction Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement ->
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on a set of given features. Lung cancer is one of the 
leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a 
predictive model that can assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

Objective ->
The primary goal is to predict whether a person has lung cancer based on various attributes related to their lifestyle, medical history, and symptoms.
The prediction model will use the provided dataset to learn patterns and relationships between these attributes and the presence of lung cancer.
The outcomes of this project can be used to raise awareness and encourage timely medical consultations for those at higher risk.

Dataset Information ->
The dataset consists of 309 entries with 16 columns. Each row represents an individual, and each column represents a specific feature or attribute of
the individual.
Column Information
❖ GENDER: Gender of the individual (M: Male, F: Female)
❖ AGE: Age of the individual
❖ SMOKING: Smoking status (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ YELLOW_FINGERS: Presence of yellow fingers, a symptom often
associated with smoking (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ ANXIETY: Presence of anxiety (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ PEER_PRESSURE: Influence of peer pressure (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ CHRONIC_DISEASE: Presence of chronic disease (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ FATIGUE: Presence of fatigue (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ ALLERGY: Presence of allergy (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ WHEEZING: Presence of wheezing (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ ALCOHOL_CONSUMING: Alcohol consumption status (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ COUGHING: Presence of coughing (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH: Presence of shortness of breath (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ SWALLOWING_DIFFICULTY: Presence of difficulty in swallowing (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ CHEST_PAIN: Presence of chest pain (YES = 2, NO = 1)
❖ LUNG_CANCER: Presence of lung cancer (YES, NO)

Predictive Modeling of Car Prices for Market Entry Strategy in the US Auto Industry
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement ->
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their 
US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want 
to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. 
The company wants to know: 
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car. How well those variables describe the price of a car. Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm 
has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the America market.

Objective ->
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the 
independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good 
way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Dataset Information ->
The dataset contains information on various cars, with several attributes (or columns) describing different aspects of each car. Here is an explanation of
each column present in the data:

Column Information ->
➢ car_ID: A unique identifier for each car.
➢ symboling: An insurance risk rating, ranging from -3 to 3, where higher values indicate a higher risk.
➢ CarName: The name of the car, which includes both the brand and model.
➢ fueltype: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., gas, diesel).
➢ aspiration: Indicates whether the car has a standard (std) or turbocharged (turbo) engine.
➢ doornumber: The number of doors on the car (e.g., two, four).
➢ carbody: The body style of the car (e.g., convertible, hatchback, sedan, wagon, hardtop).
➢ drivewheel: The type of drive system the car uses (e.g., fwd for front-wheel drive, rwd for rear-wheel drive, 4wd for four-wheel drive).
➢ enginelocation: The location of the engine in the car (e.g., front, rear).
➢ wheelbase: The distance between the front and rear axles (measured in inches).
➢ carlength: The overall length of the car (measured in inches).
➢ carwidth: The overall width of the car (measured in inches).
➢ carheight: The overall height of the car (measured in inches).
➢ curbweight: The weight of the car without passengers or cargo (measured in pounds).
➢ enginetype: The type of engine (e.g., dohc, ohcv, ohc, rotor, dohcv, l, ohcf).
➢ cylindernumber: The number of cylinders in the engine (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, eight, twelve).
➢ enginesize: The size of the engine (measured in cubic inches).
➢ fuelsystem: The type of fuel system (e.g., mpfi, 2bbl, 1bbl, spdi, 4bbl, idi, spfi).
➢ boreratio: The ratio of the bore (diameter of the cylinder) to the stroke (length of the cylinder).
➢ stroke: The length of the piston stroke within the cylinder.
➢ compressionratio: The ratio of the maximum to minimum volume in the cylinder.
➢ horsepower: The power output of the engine (measured in horsepower).
➢ peakrpm: The maximum revolutions per minute (RPM) of the engine.
➢ citympg: The fuel efficiency of the car in city driving conditions (measured in miles per gallon).
➢ highwaympg: The fuel efficiency of the car in highway driving conditions (measured in miles per gallon).
➢ price: The price of the car (measured in USD), which is the target variable for prediction.
